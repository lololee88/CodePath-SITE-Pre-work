**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Lauren Lee

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- Made clue hold time shorter to make game go by faster

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I didnt use any outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge that I had to overcome was getting used to all the different syntax. 
Since I do not have experience with HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, I had to go through 
all the references to fully understand what I was coding. For example, I was 
unfamiliar with anything related to the CSS document. I had to look at all the 
references starting with CSS declarations and the difference between the property 
and the value. The directions on the pre-work assignment were very clear and 
straightforward. It was very easy for me to get the general gist of it rather 
quickly. However, that doesn’t mean I was able to just read it over quickly and 
instantly understand everything. I had to reread the references multiple times and 
refer back to the code to get a clearer understanding more often than not. One 
reference that I spent a lot of my time trying to understand was the CSS Selector. 
I think the reason why I spent more time trying to understand this aspect was because 
the selector can be implemented in multiple ways, such as targeting the element by its 
id attribute versus targeting it by its class attribute. Also the fact that selectors 
can be combined also caused me to spend more time trying to understand. Once I was able 
to identify these aspects in my own code, it made it easier to see how it worked.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This was my first real taste of delving into the world of web development. Looking over 
the whole assignment, there were many different elements that came together to create 
this very simple game. What I am curious about now is about what a more complicated 
website would look like in terms of how many different elements there are. I can’t 
imagine how many lines of codes it takes to complete more complicated websites! This 
assignment focused on creating a game, but what other purposes can we development serve? 
How would implementing an AI work in the realm of web development? I’m very interested to 
see the many different purposes and uses web development can bring!

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely spend time refining 
the aesthetics and look of the game. I would mess around more with the colors and try to 
give actual images for both the buttons and background. One thing that I would love to try 
to implement are simple animations to go along with the button pressing instead of just 
having the button light up when it is pressed. I would also add that to the winning and 
losing screens. That would make the game so much more interesting! I would also like to mess 
around with the format, which is very linear at the moment.
